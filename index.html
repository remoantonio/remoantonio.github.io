            About the Game
        </h2>
        <p>
            Dota 2 is a moba, multi-player online battle arena, which means you compete against other people to determine a victor. Two teams of five players join a match, pick their heroes, and try to destroy the enemies base. It is played along three lanes that have defences which ultimately lead to the ancient which has to be destroyed to secure victory. There is so much more but we are here to look at picking heroes.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Dota Picker
        </h2>
        <p>
            This application will assist you in picking the most synergistic team by looking at the advantage different heroes have with each other. The synergy (positive or negative) and background color (green or red) of heroes will change depending on whether they are more or less powerful to the heroes already picked. Although having a team with high synergy helps, it is not everything and skill plays heavily into the game. Heroes are broken into three categories based on their primary attribute: Strength, Agility, and Intellect. Pick heroes, get a high synergy, have fun!
